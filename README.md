# Online-TrainTicket-Booking-System-

The provided Python code models a train ticket booking system using a class named `TrainJourney`. Each instance of this class represents a specific train journey with attributes such as departure time, return time, ticket price, total tickets available, and more. The program initializes a list of train journeys and displays their initial availability status. It then enters a loop where the user can repeatedly select a journey index and specify the number of passengers to purchase tickets. The system updates the ticket availability, records the total number of passengers and money earned for each journey, and provides information on the most popular journey. This process continues until the user decides to stop by entering -1. The final output includes the updated status of each journey, overall journey statistics, and details about the journey with the highest passenger count. The code demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of a train ticket booking system, allowing for continuous user interaction until all tickets are sold or the user opts to conclude the process.
